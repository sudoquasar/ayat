                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>A baithak is a traditional, intimate gathering where musicians perform in close proximity to the audience. Unlike formal concerts in large auditoriums, baithaks foster a personal connection between the artist and listeners. Guests typically sit on the floor in a cozy setting, creating an atmosphere where music becomes a shared, immersive experience.</p>

                            <p>We recommend comfortable, modest attire suitable for sitting on the floor. Traditional Indian wear is welcome but not mandatory. Avoid formal shoes as you'll need to remove them before entering the performance area. Think comfortable and respectful.</p>

                            <p>Children who can sit quietly and appreciate classical music for extended periods are welcome. However, given the intimate nature and duration of our performances, we recommend bringing children aged 10 and above who have an interest in music. Please book a separate ticket for each child attending.</p>
